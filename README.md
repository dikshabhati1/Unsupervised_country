# Unsupervised_country
# Problem Statement
Clustering the countries using Unsupervised Learning.
To categroize the countries so we can find the overall development of the countries, so that International NGOs can decide how much money they can spend on different countries for their development. 

# Data Source
I used data from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data

# Approach
I had seen some statistical details of the data ,find outliers with the help of boxplot. Clustering techniques that I used are K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
Visualized clusters.By doing some analysis I found which countries are developed , developing and under-developing.

# Conclusion
Both K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering had given different results.By elbow method in K-Means Clustering I got 3 number of clusters and by dendogram in Hierarchical Clustering I had chosen 3 clusters.
